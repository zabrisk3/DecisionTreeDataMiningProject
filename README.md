# Marketing Decision Tree Data Mining Project
This was a project attempting to classify whether or not people would respond to marketing, given
various information about them. Training information was provided, with the goal of predicting on 
testing information. Four Python scripts are produced that format the data, binarize the categorical
parts, fill in missing values with nearest neighbor interpolation, and then predict on the testing data.
